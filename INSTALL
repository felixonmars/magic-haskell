INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

Before you start, you will need to have libmagic installed.  I have tested
this package with version 4.12; earlier versions may or may not work.

libmagic is part of the "file" package and can be found at
ftp://ftp.astron.com/pub/file/.

Now, run "make setup" (you may need to edit the Makefile if you don't
use GHC or if your GHC is at an unusual location).

Then:

 ./setup configure
 ./setup build
 ./setup install
