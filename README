What is magic-haskell?
-------------------------

It is a binding to the C libmagic library.  It allows you to determine
the type of a file not by looking at its name or extension, but rather
by examining the contents itself.

libmagic can provide either a textual description or a MIME content
type (and, occasionally, also a character set.)

The Haskell binding can also provide reports over Haskell strings.
